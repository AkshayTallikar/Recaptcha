# Recaptcha
Recaptcha neural network using tensorflow/keras. It is a simple neural network that gets 92.2275 accuracy. I made my own csv file for the classification. It does a classification of 11 folders of images (Bicycle, Bridge, Bus, Car, Chimney,Crosswalk, Hydrant, Motorcycle, Mountain,Palm,Traffic Light).
enjoy:)
